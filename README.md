## Description

You are the protaganist in this game called Polygon Destroyer. Your job (a circle) is to eliminate the onslaught of polygons that want to get to close. Fend them off by shooting lasers out of Jeremy's eyes!

In order to stay alive, land successful hits on the polygons to increase your score

### Skills to improve
