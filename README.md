## Description

You are the protaganist in this game called Polygon Destroyer. Your job (a circle) is to eliminate the onslaught of polygons that want to get to close. Fend them off by launching Smaller versions of yourself. If you miss to many times, you will have exausted yourself and disapear!

### Skills to improve

For me part of this project is to improve my skills in all aspects of javaScript. I will be implementing all data types. I plan on working on styling the page as well as I see it as one of my weak spots.

## Where I am

So far, I have been able to make the player move in all directions on the page as well as create a projectile that moves from the origin of the player. 

I have also implimented collision detection on the walls of the game box so that the player will not be able to escape the game area. I have 3 event listeners that currently listen for mouseclicks to shoot, and key ups and downs for movement.

## What I need to do

I need to add enemies and collision detection for them as well. after I am able to add collision detection, I will be able to remove them as well as increase the score.

I also need to add a game over screen. As well as style the page.
